## What's new in 0.9.11

### New features

There are following changes in `0.9.11` compared to `0.9.7` release:

* UDP code totally rewritten - no "quick" mode ports anymore. "quick_ports" configuration option is now no-op and will be remove
in the future releases.
* new proxy multiplexer with different and more robust internal connection handover and routing
* memory pool system totally rewritten to almost lock-free mechanism
* new `diag worker list` CLI command to diagnose new worker architecture
* new `diag mem udp stats` CLI command to diagnose new UDP flow datagrams (they will become a connection)
* new config `settings/` area bool variables: `accept_tproxy`, `accept_redirect` and `accept_socks` to fully disable respective worker trees and save some idle CPU cycles + startup script support for these.
* reworked automatized build system - new binary package builds don't require any intervention and are compiled and uploaded to mag0.net/out/smithproxy repository automatically.

### Bug fixes

* `0.9.11-2` Fix new installations startup problems caused to zero size shared memory SIGBUS exit
