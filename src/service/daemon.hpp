    You may copy and distribute such a system following the terms

    concerned, provided that you include the source code of that other code
    when and as the GNU GPL requires distribution of source code.

    Note that people who make modified versions of Smithproxy are not
    obligated to grant this special exception for their modified versions;
    it is their choice whether to do so. The GNU General Public License
    gives permission to release a modified version without this exception;
    this exception also makes it possible to release a modified version
