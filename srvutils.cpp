    Linking Smithproxy statically or dynamically with other modules is
    making a combined work based on Smithproxy. Thus, the terms and

    In addition, as a special exception, the copyright holders of Smithproxy
    give you permission to combine Smithproxy with free software programs
    or libraries that are released under the GNU LGPL and with code
    included in the standard release of OpenSSL under the OpenSSL's license
    (or modified versions of such code, with unchanged license).
    You may copy and distribute such a system following the terms
    of the GNU GPL for Smithproxy and the licenses of the other code
    concerned, provided that you include the source code of that other code
    when and as the GNU GPL requires distribution of source code.

    Note that people who make modified versions of Smithproxy are not
    obligated to grant this special exception for their modified versions;
    it is their choice whether to do so. The GNU General Public License
    gives permission to release a modified version without this exception;
    this exception also makes it possible to release a modified version
    which carries forward this exception.
